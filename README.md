This translator ("Justina Colmena") is motivated by the failure of the U.S.
medical-quack-legal system to respect the universal human rights enumerated
in the original Bill of Rights, and personal legal status as "an adjudicated
mental defective" having been "committed to a mental institution" in the U.S.

This translator was born in the United States (Vancouver, Washington) but is
denied employment, housing, meedical care, birth certificate, passport, other
necessary documents for travel from and return to the United States, the right
to visit government offices to transact legitimate business, access to the
court system, the right to possess firearms and vote, and many other privileges
and rights in the United States on account of a transgender condition.
